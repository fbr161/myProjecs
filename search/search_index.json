The Schedule class has a relationship with Ticket and Accident class, having a Composition relationship with both of them. The Schedule class is also connected to the Accident class as Aggregation relationship and Bus class as Composition relationship. The Accident class has an Aggregation relationship with the Hospital and Police_Station class; While, the Bus class is connected with Schedule and Live_Tracking class through Composition relationship.
